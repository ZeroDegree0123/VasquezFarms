This is an ecommerce app where you can buy soaps. Users can add soaps to a cart then confirm their order. Every order is kept on record and users are able to view their past orders.

## Next Steps

I would like to make the app handle billing information and be full ecommerce app, currently the app doesn't accept payments. I would also like to modernize the app, make it look more professional. I would also Like to add a review feature so a user is able to rate soaps and leave reviews.
