                            I started making small batch goats milk soap in January 2021 after
                            more than a year of research. I fell in love with the process and began selling to
                            friends and family in May 2020. I love knowing where the products I use on my body
                            come from, and with encouragement and positive feedback from my family and friends 
                            I've branched out to marketing my soap beyond my close circle. I use all natural 
                            ingredients in my soap products. I hope to expand my body care line later this year!

{/* Although we both have full time jobs off the farm, my husband and I 
are homesteaders at heart!  We enjoy caring for our many animals, building structures for 
them and expanding our farm. I love to garden, and hope to one day produce most of our own 
food. My husband has recently started wood working, I hope to be able to begin selling some 
of his creations in the near future. */}
